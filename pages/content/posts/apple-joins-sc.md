We are happy to welcome Apple to the [Steering Committee of Open Web Docs](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/steering-committee/membership-expectations.md)! They are joining our mission to document the web for developers.

The Steering Committee is responsible for deciding what Open Web Docs should work on and with what priorities, as illustrated by our [2022 goals](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/2022-goals.md).

Weâ€™re excited to have representatives from all major web browser vendors in the Steering Committee of Open Web Docs, providing us with support so we can cater to and help developers globally to build better documentation on the web across all browsers.
