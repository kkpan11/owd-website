Many of us are unknowingly responsible for microaggressions in our everyday interactions, including when we write content and create examples for MDN. The Open Web Docs team has been working to reduce the occurrence of microaggressions and up the number of micro-benevolences throughout MDN.

## Reducing microaggressions

Microaggressions are demeaning experiences in seemingly normal daily interactions from generally well-intentioned people who are completely unaware that their behavior is non-inclusive and even offensive.

The use of stereotypes is an environmental microaggression. This may be manifested by who is portrayed as a knowledgeable teacher versus who is portrayed as naive and needing to learn. The absence of diversity is also an environmental microaggression. Ensuring representation in curricula and the overall culture of an organization in general improves diversity. The absence of diversity or the inclusion of only or mainly cis-hetero-white-men of North American or European descent in relationships with power dynamics in prose and code are environmental microaggressions.

When people are not represented, they feel invisible. When people from minoritized communities do not see themselves represented in learning or workplace settings, which includes MDN, they can feel isolated, lonely, and excluded. When the only minoritized representations are of learners and students, these microaggressions can lead to feelings of worthlessness and a lack of confidence.

Microaggressions aren't just related birth-based differences. Language is important for all readers. Describing something as "simple" or "easy", or telling a developer to "just" makes those who don't find something simple or easy, or have never encountered a task, API, or property can lead to feelings of inadequacy or incompetence, and can increase imposter syndromes. Microaggressions negatively impact everyone's mental and emotional health.

The OWD team has been working to remove potential microaggressions on MDN content. For example, when we encounter words that minimize the complexity of tasks, we remove them.

## Adding micro-benevelonces

A micro-benevolence is a small act of kindness that benefits another person, without expecting reciprocity. Micro benevolences can be as simple as including culturally sensitive names in code examples or putting primary parent and secondary parent on a form instead of defaulting to cis-gendered, heteronormative, patriarchal norms.

In addition to removing potential microaggressions on MDN, the OWD team has been working to create micro-benevolences when updating code examples and adding imagery. When we update code examples to more modern code standards we also update the example itself to reflect the diversity of our readers. By increasing the diversity of cultures, genders, ages, and topics portrayed in code examples, more of our readers will feel seen and included, and more of our readers will be exposed to cultures, genders, ages, and topics of interest not their own.

### Diversifying code examples

For example, when learning to code, you will often come across John Doe and Mike Smith in code examples, with the occasional Jane and Kimberly.  The OWD team went thru the content directory and updated these examples to better reflect the diversity of developers. The first names in a [table of names](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) include common first names of different cultures, such as Diego, Shilpa, Caterina, Jayla, Aisha, Kyouko, and Shireen, and non-gendered names, such as Dominique, Jayla, and Gila; not just John Doe and Mike Smith, and the occasional Jane and Kimberly.  Opportunities for benevolences abound, such as a [table was a list of names and countries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child#using_of_selector_to_fix_striped_tables) where we included country-appropriate names, and even indigenous names, like Tlayolotl for Mexico.  With a little bit of effort, and mostly awareness, we hope to make all people feel included and seen.

We also included examples that made people who are often discriminated against and marginalized feel included. On the web, many code examples are geared toward math or science fiction lovers. While we haven’t removed all references to Star Wars, all male sports teams, planets, or Pythagorean, we’ve included [quotes by Maya Angelou](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow), [SVGs of mandalas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Filter_Effects/Using_filter_effects#applying_repeated_filters), and a welcome to our [trans](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow?retiredLocale=de#setting_zero_for_offset_and_blur) friends.

We also work to encourage being aware of historical discrimination and exclusion and how our history impacts our examples. A volunteer contributor suggested a code example that included the top scorers for the world cup in 1954. Originally, FIFA allocated only one place to the three continents of Africa, Asia, and Oceania in the World Cup. It’s important to be cognizant that readers may not be aware of this history; while most know FIFA excluded women, most don’t know that over half of the world’s male population was also excluded. In this case, we guided PR to use a more inclusive statistic. In so doing, we both improve the inclusion in this single example and guided MDN volunteer contributors to be aware of being mindful when choosing content for examples.
