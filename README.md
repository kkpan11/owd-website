# Open Web Docs

This is the codebase for [Open Web Docs](https://openwebdocs.org) built upon the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) framework.

## Setup

Clone the repository, then run `npm i` to install the dev dependencies.

## Run Locally

Once you've performed the setup, you can run this codebase locally by running `npm run serve` in your terminal. This will serve the site to `localhost:8081`. The site will automatically rebuild and reload the browser page when modifications are detected.

## Build

If you want to perform a simple build of the site, you can run `npm run build`. This will build the site and output the files to the `_site` folder.

adds the `img` directory to `_site` so that it can be output to the browser.

## Contribution

## Add New Folder

If you want to include a new directory that you want outputted to the browser, you'll need to add it to the list of dircetories in `.eleventy.js`; for example:

```js
    // Copy `img/` to `_site/img`
  eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("img");
```

### Gotchas

There are some things to be aware of when making changes.
1. The `theme.css` includes rules for `prefers-color-scheme("dark")` and `body.dark` which are exactly the same this is so that folks can use dark mode regardless of their system preferences. If you make changes to one, ensure you make changes to the other.
   1. If you're making changes to dark mode ensure that you're prefacing all new rules with `body.dark` and `body.systemDarkPreference` respectively.
2. For collections (posts, reports, worklog), there is an accomponying json file which includes global rules for the files that live in the related directory; for example:
   ```json
   {
     "layout": "layouts/post.njk",
     "tags": [
        "post"
    ]
   }
   ```
   This is setting the layout for all posts and ensures that each post has the tag `post` so that all posts can be included in the posts collection.
3. If you create a file that you don't want included in a collection, include `eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true` in the front-matter.
